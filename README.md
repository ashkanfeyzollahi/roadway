**Roadway** is a straightforward but fun arcade-style car game where you dodge oncoming traffic on a scrolling two-lane road. React fast, switch lanes, and try to survive as long as you can â€” or crash and explode in flames!

Built using [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/), this game features smooth animations, sound effects, and simple keyboard controls. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to make their first 2D game in Lua.
